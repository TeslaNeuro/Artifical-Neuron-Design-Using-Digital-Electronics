# Artifical-Neuron-Design-Using-Digital-Electronics
- An Artifical Neuron purely using Digital Electronics mimicing a traffic light controller.
- You can simulate and run the .circ file on an application called [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).
- Will be uploading a detailed explanation on system and subsystem circuitry so you can better understand the fundamentals on how to adapt it to your application.
