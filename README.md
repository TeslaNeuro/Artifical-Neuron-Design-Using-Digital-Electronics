# Artifical-Neuron-Design-Using-Digital-Electronics
- An Artifical Neuron purely using Digital Electronics mimicing a traffic light controller.
- You can simulate and run the .circ file on an application called [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).
- Relu Activation function used to develop the Artifical Neuron.
- It's not a nerual network it only mimics a neuron.

## Digital Neuron Simulation Project
This project simulates the function of a single artificial neuron using digital logic components. The neuron, implemented in Logisim, is a foundational part of an artificial neural network (ANN) which is often used in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. By constructing a neuron with bit adders, activation functions, and other digital logic components, this project provides insights into how a neuron processes input signals and generates outputs based on defined conditions.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a simplified, digital model of a neuron that can:

- Process Binary Inputs: Sum multiple binary inputs using a bit adder circuit.
- Apply an Activation Function: Transform the output based on specific criteria to mimic the activation of a neuron.
- Detect Patterns: Recognize predefined bit patterns within the output stream, which is a fundamental part of how neurons process information.
- Provide Visual Feedback: Display the results of pattern detection and activation via an LED system that changes based on input conditions.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- overview.md: A detailed introduction to the project’s context and purpose.
- system_specifications.md: Breakdown of each digital component, including the bit adder, activation function, pattern recognition circuit, and more.
- design_and_simulation.md: Design process, circuit diagrams, and simulation details.
- testing.md: Documentation of testing procedures and validation results.
- conclusion.md: Summary of project outcomes, observations, and potential future improvements.

## Key Concepts
This project leverages basic concepts of neural networks and digital design, including:

- Binary Addition and Logic Gates: Using a bit adder and logic gates to create a sum of inputs, similar to the way neurons sum input signals.
- Activation Functions: Mimicking a neuron’s behavior by producing outputs only when certain conditions are met.
- Pattern Recognition: Detecting specific binary patterns, akin to how neurons detect particular features in a dataset.

## Future Enhancements
If time and resources permit, future enhancements could involve:

Extending to Multi-layer Neurons: Expanding this single neuron model to include multiple layers, creating a small neural network.
Experimenting with Real Hardware: Translating the circuit design from Logisim to physical components.
Applying Machine Learning Concepts: Integrating this neuron model into larger machine learning frameworks for training and learning tasks.
This high-level digital neuron simulation offers both educational insight into neural network behavior and a practical demonstration of digital design principles.
